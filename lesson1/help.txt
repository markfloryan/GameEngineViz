Welcome to Lesson 1!

Mario is stuck! You'll have to help him move by coding in movement options for him!

Start out by viewing the Lesson.js file. You'll notice that you cannot edit code in the red areas; however, viewing code in these read-only areas might prove useful!
Open the developer console using CTRL + SHIFT + I. Here, you can see console outputs coming from the game. Currently, if you press a key, you'll see its corresponding key code printed to the screen!
Use this in conjunction with this.mario's moveX() and moveY() functions to pick up all the coins!
